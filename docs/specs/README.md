# Public specs workflow

Canonical specs live privately in `docs-private/`.

We keep sanitized, public-safe Markdown mirrors in `docs/specs/` that contain no sensitive or proprietary details.

Update flow:

1. Update the private spec in `docs-private/`.
2. Create or refresh the sanitized Markdown mirror in `docs/specs/`.
3. Commit the public Markdown mirror to the repo.
