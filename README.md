## Built with AI (seriously)

This project is built with AI coding agents (e.g., Codex) to accelerate development. That said, I’m treating it like a real software project:

- human review of meaningful diffs
- tests + linting as a baseline gate
- eval harnesses for extraction/rollups where correctness matters
- metrics published as the system matures

The goal is to produce something genuinely useful for users. But I’m also using this repo to sharpen my ability to work effectively with AI tools, while remaining skeptical of the hype.
